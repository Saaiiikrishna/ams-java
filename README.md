# Attendance Management System

This project contains a Spring Boot backend and React front-end modules for managing attendance via NFC cards. The backend lives in `src/main/java` and can be started with Maven:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The `admin-panel` and `entity-dashboard` directories contain separate React applications.
