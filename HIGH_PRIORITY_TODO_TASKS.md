## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA
1. All microservices must remain functional after shared-lib cleanup
2. All user types must be able to access appropriate endpoints
3. Complete workflow from SuperAdmin → EntityAdmin → Member must work
4. Both direct access and API Gateway access must work identically
5. All discovered issues must be documented and resolved
