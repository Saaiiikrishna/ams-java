# Mock SeetaFace6 JNI Implementation

⚠️ **WARNING: This is a MOCK implementation for testing purposes only!**

## What is this?

This directory contains a mock JNI implementation that simulates SeetaFace6 functionality.

## For Production Use:

To use real SeetaFace6:
1. Replace mock files with real SeetaFace6 components
2. Use the real JNI implementation from src/main/cpp/seetaface_jni.cpp
3. Build with actual SeetaFace6 libraries

Platform: windows
Purpose: Integration testing without real SeetaFace6
