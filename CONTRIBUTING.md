## How to Contribute

We use GitHub to manage contributions. Please use GitHub issues and pull requests to contribute.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo-path/issues). <!-- TODO: Replace with actual repo path -->

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-repo-path/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements or New Features

If you have an idea for an enhancement or a new feature, please first check the existing [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo-path/issues) to see if your idea has already been discussed. <!-- TODO: Replace with actual repo path -->

If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/your-repo-path/issues/new) providing a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, its potential benefits, and any examples or mockups if applicable. This allows for discussion before significant development work begins.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through `good first issue` or `help wanted` issues:
<!-- TODO: Replace with actual repo path for these labels -->
- [Good first issues](https://github.com/your-repo-path/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/your-repo-path/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issues`.

### Pull Requests

If you have code to contribute:

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** locally: `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git`
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-number`.
4.  **Make your changes** and commit them with clear, descriptive messages.
5.  **Push your changes** to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
6.  **Open a pull request** from your fork's branch to the main repository's `main` or `develop` branch (please check which branch is used for active development).
7.  Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Getting Started & Development Setup

For information on setting up your development environment, building the project, and running tests, please refer to our main [README.md](./README.md) file.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure the following:

1.  **Your code adheres to the existing code style.** (Details on coding style can be added here or in a separate `STYLEGUIDE.md`).
2.  **Include tests** that cover your changes. New features should have new tests, and bug fixes should include tests that demonstrate the bug and verify the fix.
3.  **Ensure all tests pass** locally before submitting.
4.  **Keep your pull request focused.** Address one issue or feature per PR.
5.  **Write a clear and concise PR description.** Explain the "what" and "why" of your changes.
6.  **Link to any relevant issues** in your PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123").
7.  **Rebase your branch** on the latest version of the target branch before submitting if there are conflicts or significant upstream changes.

## Coding Standards

(Placeholder: This section can be expanded with specific coding conventions for Java, React, TypeScript, Kotlin, Swift, etc. For now, try to match the style and patterns of the existing codebase.)

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
