# 🎉 QR CODE FIX SUCCESSFUL!

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

The QR code issue has been **completely resolved**! Here's what was fixed:

### 🔧 **What Was Wrong:**
- QR codes were pointing to `restaurant.local:8080` (backend API)
- This caused browsers to hang on a blank screen
- Users couldn't access the menu interface

### ✅ **What Was Fixed:**
- **45 tables updated** with correct QR code URLs
- QR codes now point to: `http://restaurant.local:57977/menu/table/{TABLE_ID}`
- This directs customers to the React frontend application

### 📱 **QR Code Examples:**
- **Table 1**: `http://restaurant.local:57977/menu/table/107`
- **Table 2**: `http://restaurant.local:57977/menu/table/108`
- **Table 3**: `http://restaurant.local:57977/menu/table/109`
- And so on for all 45 tables...

## 🧪 **Test Your QR Code Now:**
