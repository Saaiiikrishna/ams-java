### 5. **Infrastructure Centralization**
- ✅ Moved all Docker configurations to `infrastructure/docker/`
- ✅ Centralized database scripts in `infrastructure/database/`
- ✅ Organized nginx configs in `infrastructure/nginx/`
- ✅ Centralized monitoring in `infrastructure/monitoring/`
- ✅ Moved Docker Compose files to `infrastructure/`

### 6. **Cleanup and Organization**
- ✅ Moved build artifacts to `mreview/` for manual review
- ✅ Removed temporary files and build outputs
- ✅ Preserved all important files
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### **For Developers**
- ✅ **Faster Navigation:** Find components quickly
- ✅ **Clear Separation:** No confusion about where files belong
- ✅ **Better IDE Support:** Modern IDEs work better with organized structures
- ✅ **Easier Onboarding:** New developers understand structure immediately

### **For Project Management**
- ✅ **Professional Appearance:** Looks like a well-maintained enterprise project
- ✅ **Scalable Structure:** Ready for future growth
- ✅ **Technology Separation:** Easy to assign teams to specific areas
- ✅ **Deployment Ready:** Infrastructure components are centralized

### **For Maintenance**
- ✅ **Easier Refactoring:** Components are logically grouped
- ✅ **Better Dependency Management:** Clear boundaries between components
- ✅ **Simplified Builds:** No more build artifacts cluttering the workspace
- ✅ **Cleaner Repository:** Reduced size and complexity

## 📋 What's Next?

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Test All Applications** - Ensure everything still works after restructuring
2. **Update Build Scripts** - Modify any scripts that reference old paths
3. **Update CI/CD Pipelines** - Adjust deployment scripts for new structure
4. **Review mreview/ Folder** - Check if any files need to be moved back

### **Recommended Improvements**
1. **Add .gitignore Rules** - Prevent future build artifact accumulation
2. **Create Workspace Configuration** - For VS Code or other IDEs
3. **Implement Monorepo Tools** - Consider Lerna, Nx, or similar tools
4. **Standardize Naming** - Ensure consistent conventions across all projects

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### **Backend Development**
```bash
# Monolithic
cd backend/monolithic
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Microservices
cd infrastructure
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up
```

### **Frontend Development**
```bash
# Admin Panel
cd frontend/admin-panel
npm install && npm start

# Entity Dashboard
cd frontend/entity-dashboard
npm install && npm start

# Public Menu
cd frontend/public-menu
npm install && npm start
```

### **Mobile Development**
```bash
# Android
cd mobile/android/[app-name]
# Open in Android Studio

# iOS
cd mobile/ios/[app-name]
# Open in Xcode
```

### **Infrastructure Management**
```bash
# Start all services
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# Microservices deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d

# Production deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
