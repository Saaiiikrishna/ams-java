## Important Reminders
- Always check this file when in doubt about next steps
- Mark tasks as completed when finished: [x]
- Update current status after each major milestone
- Keep notes about any issues or decisions made during implementation
- Use the folder 'useless' to store all unwanted files. DO NOT DELETE / REMOVE ANY FILES. If you cannot find the folder 'useless', create it in the root directory of the project.
