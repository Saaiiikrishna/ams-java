## Current Status
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 (Domain Separation with gRPC)
- **Last Completed**: Phase 1 - Build Verification
- **Next Milestone**: Complete domain boundary analysis and gRPC service design

## Notes
- Phase 1 completed successfully with both backend and Android builds working
- APK file generated and copied to desktop: `subscriber-app-debug.apk`
- Ready to proceed with Phase 2: Domain separation and gRPC implementation
- All subsequent phases depend on successful completion of Phase 2

## Important Reminders
- Always check this file when in doubt about next steps
- Mark tasks as completed when finished: [x]
- Update current status after each major milestone
- Keep notes about any issues or decisions made during implementation
