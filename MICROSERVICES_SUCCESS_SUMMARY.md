## 🔧 Critical Issues Resolved

### **Issue 1: API Gateway Routing (RESOLVED)**
- **Problem**: 404 errors for Organization and Attendance services
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect URI configuration and StripPrefix settings
- **Solution**: Fixed routing configuration with proper RewritePath rules
- **Result**: All services accessible via API Gateway ✅

### **Issue 2: Password Hashing (RESOLVED)**
- **Problem**: EntityAdmin authentication failing due to password mismatch
- **Root Cause**: Plain text passwords stored instead of BCrypt hashes
- **Solution**: Implemented password hashing via Auth Service before storage
- **Result**: EntityAdmin authentication working perfectly ✅

### **Issue 3: Modern Auth Routing (RESOLVED)**
- **Problem**: Modern Auth v2 endpoints not accessible via API Gateway
- **Root Cause**: Missing route configuration for /api/auth/v2/** endpoints
- **Solution**: Added dedicated routing for Modern Auth endpoints
- **Result**: EntityAdmin login working via API Gateway ✅

### **Issue 4: Shared Library Architecture (DOCUMENTED)**
- **Problem**: Entity models in shared library violating microservices boundaries
- **Root Cause**: Attendance Service directly accessing entity repositories
- **Status**: Documented for future refactoring (non-blocking for current functionality)
- **Impact**: Current functionality preserved, architectural improvement identified
